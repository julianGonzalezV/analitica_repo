# NumPy
 NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

- a powerful N-dimensional array object
- sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
- tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

NumPyâ€™s main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array
In NumPy dimensions are called axes.

multidimensional or N-dimensional refers to the fact of having severals dimension : see dimensions.png in this 
folder

Restrictions:
Unlike with Python lists, every value in an ndarray must be of the same types:
Por eso en el ejemplo convertimos todo a float

functions:
ndarray.shape --> it retunrs a tuple(inmutable lists in python) where the first value is the the amount of records in the 
first dimmension or ROWS IN THE DATA SET axe and 
the second refers to the number of columns ON THE DATA SET or the number of items long in the second dimension
